# rock-paper-scissors-game
A simple Python-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. This program allows players to compete against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the program determines the winner based on the game's rules. Players can play multiple rounds and exit at any time.
